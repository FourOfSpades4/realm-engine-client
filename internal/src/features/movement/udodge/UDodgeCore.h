// radius source shared by the immediate solver and the grid pathfinder. Exposed
// so the game thread can RE-VALIDATE the actual movement step against the CURRENT
// (re-anchored) enemy positions every frame, not only at solve time.

// endpoint-tested only, and a step is up to ~1.9 tiles while the no-go circle is
// ~1.01 tiles across — so the dodge could cheerfully slice straight through a mob
// with both ends of the step clear. Same cost shape as SegmentSafety's zone term
// (one point-segment distance per enemy). Falls back to the endpoint rule when
// `from` is ALREADY inside a body, for the same reason ZonePathClear does: every
// move out of a circle necessarily sweeps it, and vetoing those would trap the
// player under a mob that walked onto them.
//
// NOTE: in RotMG an enemy body does not physically block the player, so this is
// an INTENT-level "don't melee" rule, not a collision constraint. It is therefore
// applied to the SAFE-set admission and to committed steps — never to the
// least-bad fallback path, which is the surround-escape and must stay as
// permissive as it was.

// outside every telegraph. FINDING G-2: pending zones are documented as
// "cost-only (soft)" throughout this engine and NO cost term existed — nothing
// read them at all, so a bomb 1.2 s out was invisible to both the solver and the
// planner. This is the quantity that cost is built from (kSolvePendingW), and the
