// UDodge pathfinder worker (plan 65) — the background thread that runs the grid
// Dijkstra (Path::Compute) decoupled from render/update frame rate. Rebuilt fresh
// from the retired plan-58/59 planner seam for the new grid pathfinder.
//
// THREAD-BOUNDARY CONTRACT (mandatory): the worker touches ONLY the plain-data
// Path::PlannerSnapshot and writes a plain-data Path::PlanResult. It never calls
// IL2CPP, never reads a game object, never dereferences an Env function pointer.
// All IL2CPP reads and all movement execution stay on the game-update thread
// (UDodge::Tick), which publishes snapshots and consumes plans through the
// non-blocking handoff below. The game thread NEVER blocks on the worker; its
// immediate micro-dodge stays the safety floor even when the route is stale.
