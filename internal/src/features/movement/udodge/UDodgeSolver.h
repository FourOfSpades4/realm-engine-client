// UDodge per-tick safe-position solver (plan 64). Each server tick it computes
// the player position — within the legal per-tick move budget — that lies
// OUTSIDE every bullet's server hit region (safety is a HARD constraint,
// including the player half-extent via Core::PointSafety) and is best by a
// smart-direction objective, then hands that target back so UDodge::Tick can
// drive the player there through the game's own speed-clamped MoveTo.
//
// Pure data + math over the plain-data DangerMap and the Env probes already in
// MapInput. No IL2CPP, no globals, no worker thread.
//
// LOOKAHEAD (plan 64 / grid pathfinder plan 65). The per-tick candidate set only
// reaches one move budget, so a greedy "safest cell NOW" pick has no way to PLAN
// toward a gap it cannot reach in a single step — in a dense shot wall it
// dead-ends inside a shot, and a straight-line pocket search cannot route AROUND
// a wall/bullet-wall to a safe gap off the direct ray. On top of the immediate
// layer the solver consumes a WAYPOINT ROUTE produced by the async grid
// pathfinder (UDodgePathfinder, run on the UDodge::Worker thread): a bounded grid
// Dijkstra that curves around blocked/dangerous cells to the nearest durable-safe
// cell, expanding its window outward when nothing safe is near. The route's first
// step (≈ one budget ahead) is the pre-position target; over ticks the player
// follows the curve around the obstacle. The route is a LOOKAHEAD BIAS only — it
// may be a tick or two stale, and the immediate layer stays authoritative.
//
// TEMPORAL. The pocket test is TIME-parameterized: it predicts where every
// relevant bullet is GOING (reusing the trajectory the sensors already traced,
// LaneThreat::pointTimesMs — no re-prediction) and asks whether the player's
// along-path position is clear AT THE MOMENT the player is actually there. This
// threads gaps in TIME (stand where a bullet only WILL be, or has already
// passed) that the static whole-path test forbids, with a comfort margin so a
// slightly-off prediction can't clip. The instantaneous lane-based safety stays
// the CONSERVATIVE FLOOR for the immediate reflex; temporal only upgrades the
// lookahead/pre-positioning. The trigger is a durability test on the current
// spot: if a bullet will sweep through it over the horizon (a wall closing),
// walk the validated path to the pocket now; only when the stand is itself a
// durable temporal pocket do we HOLD.
//
// IN-RANGE DISK (locked boss). When a boss is LOCKED (goal.fromLock, goal.maxRange
// = weaponRange) the movement manifold is the FILLED DISK of radius weaponRange
// around the boss — every spot from which the boss is still hittable. The grid
// pathfinder CONSTRAINS its goal cells to that disk: it routes to the NEAREST safe
// cell ANYWHERE inside weapon range (cutting across the inside of the disk or
// drifting to the far side, whatever the nearest safe spot is), keeping the boss
// hittable. The stay-in-range preference is governed by kSolveOutRangeW on the
// immediate reflex and the disk gate on the route search. Safety STILL OVERRIDES:
// if no safe cell exists inside the disk the pathfinder re-runs UNCONSTRAINED
// (leave range to dodge, then return once clear — PlanResult::outOfRange). This
// constraint applies ONLY when locked; unlocked play is unchanged.
//
// HONEST GUARANTEE. "Numerically impossible to get hit" holds ONLY for the
// SolveKind::Safe case: a provably-safe point existed within the move budget
// and we placed the player there. When the reachable disk is fully covered
// (Fallback / Surrounded) the player CAN be hit; the solver then minimizes
// exposure (max-min-clearance) but cannot guarantee zero hits. That bound is a
// physical consequence of the per-tick move budget, not a solver weakness.
